# visitor-guestbook

A visitor guestbook assignment, using forms, SQL, servers and databases.

## (Required)

🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
• Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.
• Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.
• Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form
• Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table
• Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database
• Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
• Delete button
• Filter
• Like

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
• Trying to translate the logic from POST to DELETE an item from the web page and the API.
• I didn't quite get the chance to tackle the Filter or Like options.

## (Optional)

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
• The styling went quite well, I was able to create an app that works on different device sizes and takes into account how the user would use it in the most efficient way.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
• https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns12ALe8aqI&t=774s --> Flexbox

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
• I had an odd bug where my form information was not being submitted, after changing something on the Supabase table it seemed to work.
